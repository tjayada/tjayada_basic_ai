# Welcome to my lichess-bot
This bot uses <a href="https://lichess.org/@/tjayada">games that I've played</a>  as an openening book. These games can be found in the data folder for the respective color. A Negamax search algorithm with a depth of 3 is figuring out everything else. In combination with the Piece-Square table from <a href="https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish">sunfish</a> , this still results in a rather weak bot, but it was fun to implement nonetheless.
Also I'm waiting for the lovely people of <a href="https://maiachess.com">Maia Chess</a>  to release their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10086">newest paper and code</a> , which describe the process of creating a Neural Network that can be indiviualized for different players. 

Of course special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot">ShailChoksi</a> and their lichess-bot.

(As you can see, it does quite a lot of mistakes)
